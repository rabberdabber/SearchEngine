# SearchEngine

(1) an event-based server with I/O multiplexing to handle requests, and
- Bootstrapping: The server makes an inverted index of words in all documents in the folder. This is done when the server is started, and the server should store the generated indice
s in the memory. 
- Searching: the server program handles a large
number of request with a 10 threads in a thread pool, and it should respond to rel
evant documents and lines by the queried words.
(2) There are 2 client programs that send multiple requests to a Web server.

# Test environment 
Ubuntu 18.04 build-essential

# how to run the server
[server_name] [absolute_path_to_target] [port]

# how to test using client1
Thus, the command line should be “./client1 [server_ip] [server_port]
[number_of_threads] [number_of_requests_per_thread] [word_to_search]”, (e.g., ./client 127.0.0.1 8080 100 1000 abcd)

# how to test using client2
./client2 [server_ip] [server_port]
